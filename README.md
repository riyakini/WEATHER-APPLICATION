The Weather Application is a simple yet effective web app that fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a user-friendly interface. I developed this project during my internship with CodTech, where the goal was to integrate API data into a responsive web application.

I created a new project folder and initialized it in VS Code. The project structure was organized as follows:

/WEATHER-APPLICATION

 ├── index.html
 
 ├── style.css
 
 ├── script.js
 
 ├── README.md
 
 ├── assets (for icons or images)

used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the app, ensuring a clean and minimal UI for better usability.
Before fetching data from the API, I focused on designing a simple and interactive UI. The main components of the interface included:

Search bar: Allows users to enter a city name.
Weather display section: Shows temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
Icons: Used to represent weather conditions (e.g., sun, clouds, rain).

To get real-time weather data, I signed up on OpenWeatherMap and obtained an API key. I then used JavaScript (fetch API) to request data from OpenWeatherMap based on user input.
To make the app functional, I wrote a script (script.js) that:

Captures user input (city name).
Sends a request to OpenWeatherMap API.
Retrieves and processes the response.
Updates the UI with weather details.

To ensure the app works smoothly, I implemented error handling:

Invalid city-input: Displays an alert if the city is not found.
Empty input field: Prevents empty searches.
API failures: Logs errors to the console if the API request fails.

This Weather Application was a great project that helped me strengthen my skills in JavaScript, API integration, and responsive web design. The final product is a fully functional and visually appealing weather app that provides users with real-time weather updates.

By working on this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

✅ Fetching data from an external API.

✅ Handling asynchronous JavaScript (fetch and async/await).

✅ Implementing real-world error handling.

✅ Improving UI/UX with CSS and JavaScript.

This project was completed as part of my internship at CodTech.
